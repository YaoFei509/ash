\section{Abstract} 
This is a small case study in the 2012 release of the Ada programming language. The motivation of this case study is to expose one to the broadest topics of the Ada programming language via a detailed example. The topic I have chosen is to write up a very simple web server. A web server typically, has to deal with the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Concurrency
\item Sockets, and messaging
\item The Protocol (in this case \textbf{http})
\item Different Filesystems support
\end{itemize} 
This document is hoped to help the curious reader to learn the language with a little more ease, introcduce the http protocol slightly, and provide references where possible to direct to sources for more exploration. This is also used for my personal notes. 

\subsection{The name `Axios'}
Axios stands for ``Ada eXtra ineffectual Object Oriented Server''. And it is just that!
