\section{Implementation}
This section will deal with the more technical aspects of this case study. From
now on we will list topics that have to do with the implementation of the simple
Http server.

\subsection{Defining the required GNAT Project File Specification}
The specifications list the following requirements for the directory structures: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item{src} The directory to contain the sources
  \item{obj} The directory to contain the compiler output
  \item{bin} The directory to contain the binaries
  \item{tests} The directory to contain the tests
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{GNAT Project File}
Here is the project file we will be using.
\lstinputlisting[language=Ada]{../src/axios.gpr}
Notice that some of the flags for the compiler in both release, and debug modes 
are the same flags used for GNU C++ compiler.
