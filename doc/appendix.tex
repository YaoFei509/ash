\section{Appendix}
The appendix will give some extra simplified information which might help understand the smaller parts of the given case study. Explanations and code listings are provided as best as possible.

\subsection{Networking}
A lot of the networking will seem very familiar to you if you have used BSD C Sockets. Provided are two Ada procedures. One listener, and one sender. The Listener listens for incoming connections. If a message is intercepted, the message is uppercased, and sent back to the client. 
The client simply sends a string message to the listener. The listener listens at port 3000 (it is assumed these procedures run on your local machine, together).
