\section{Appendix}
The appendix will give some extra simplified information which might help understand the smaller parts of the given case study. Explanations and code listings are provided as best as possible.

\subsection{Networking}
A lot of the networking will seem very familiar to you if you have used BSD C Sockets. Provided are two Ada procedures. One listener, and one sender. The Listener listens for incoming connections. If a message is intercepted, the message is uppercased, and sent back to the client. 
The client simply sends a string message to the listener. The listener listens at port 3000 (it is assumed these procedures run on your local machine, together).

\subsection{Task Oriented Concurrency Model}
Concurrency in Ada uses tasks. Here is a small example to demonstrate this feature of the language that exploits a very interesting way of achieving concurrent tasks. If more detail is required, refer to \cite{AdaTasking}

\subsubsection{Simple Concurrent Program}
This is the simplest example in using tasks in Ada. The example was adapted from notes found in \cite{AdaConcurrent}, and was also the first concurrent program I wrote for testing and understanding tasks, the first time around.

This procedure would have the following output:

\section{Random Notes}
Some other miscellanious random notes, that might help in the future. 

\subsection{ADS / ADB file location}
If the \textit{gcc-ada} compiler is being used, the specification and body files can typically be found in the following directory
$$ /usr/lib/gcc/\$MACHTYPE/\$GCC-VERSION/adainclude/ $$

\subsection{Sanity Checking}
I wanted to test out if things were working properly every now and then. Here are a few commands that I used in order to do this.

\subsubsection{Using Telnet to conenct to a Http Server}
You can use telnet to connect to a http server, and write the headers manually, and receive the actual response. This helps at understanding a little more how the protocol works, and was used in order to debug the server.

\subsubsection{Using ncat to dump packets to a binary file}
On the various stages of debugging, \textit{ncat} was used in order to dump the packets to a file, in order for inspection. This helped when I was facing trouble when the socket would send random garbage due to mistakes to the http servers, and have undesired consequences.
