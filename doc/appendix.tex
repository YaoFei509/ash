\section{Appendix}
The appendix will give some extra simplified information which might help understand the smaller parts of the given case study. Explanations and code listings are provided as best as possible.

\subsection{Networking}
A lot of the networking will seem very familiar to you if you have used BSD C Sockets. Provided are two Ada procedures. One listener, and one sender. The Listener listens for incoming connections. If a message is intercepted, the message is uppercased, and sent back to the client. 
The client simply sends a string message to the listener. The listener listens at port 3000 (it is assumed these procedures run on your local machine, together).

\subsection{Task Oriented Concurrency Model}
Concurrency in Ada uses tasks. Here is a small example to demonstrate this feature of the language that exploits a very interesting way of achieving concurrent tasks. If more detail is required, refer to \cite{AdaTasking}

\subsubsection{Simple Concurrent Program}
This is the simplest example in using tasks in Ada. The example was adapted from notes found in \cite{AdaConcurrent}, and was also the first concurrent program I wrote for testing and understanding tasks, the first time around.
