# Axios

Axios is an "Ada eXtremely Ineffectual Object Oriented Server". And it is just
that!

This is a case study of mine to learn the language, and as a side effect learn
more about protocols through practice.

More elaboration will not be done here - refer to the latex manual to read
about everything. Hopefully this document and provided sources can help whoever
comes accross it.
