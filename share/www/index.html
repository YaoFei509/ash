  <p> Contributions are always welcome to this project. However, one has to
  remember that this project is an educational case study that aims to
  demonstrate many aspects of the Ada programming language, without other
  noise. For example improving the software architecture of this project in
  order to make it a more 'useful' server is not within this scope of this
  case study...</p>

  you are more than welcome to, provided that you add explanations and learning
  material to the given latex document (which is in the same repository).</p>
